* Explain where these features are within your app.
* How do users find these new features?
* Which users will this benefits, or how exactly will this benefits them?
* E.g. "[Who benefits?] Apple Watch users will be particularly happy with the latest release. [Why?] We now automatically support handoff with your Mac. [Where/how?] Don’t forget to have your bluetooth turned on, you can do it]!"

## IMPROVED
* N/A

## FIXED
* List out any major bugs that might have affected many users.
* If you've only addressed minor fixes, or nothing specific, use something like:
* E.g. "Minor Bug fixes"
* Keep the "Fixed" title if you've included other titled sections.
